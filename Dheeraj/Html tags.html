      As Michael Harvey writes, paragraphs are “in essence—a form of
      punctuation, and like other forms of punctuation they are meant to make
      written material easy to read.”[1] Effective paragraphs are the
      fundamental units of academic writing; consequently, the thoughtful,
      multifaceted arguments that your professors expect depend on them. Without
      good paragraphs, you simply cannot clearly convey sequential points and
      their relationships to one another. Many novice writers tend to make a
      sharp distinction between content and style, thinking that a paper can be
      strong in one and weak in the other, but focusing on organization shows
      how content and style converge in deliberative academic writing. Your
      professors will view even the most elegant prose as rambling and tedious
      if there isn’t a careful, coherent argument to give the text meaning.
      Paragraphs are the “stuff ” of academic writing and, thus, worth our
      attention here.
