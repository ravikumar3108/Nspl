ReactJS is a JavaScript library used to build reusable components for the view layer in MVC architecture. It is highly efficient and uses a virtual DOM to render components. It works on the client side and is written in JSX.

Components: These are reusable blocks of code that return HTML.
JSX: It stands for JavaScript and XML and allows you to write HTML in React.
Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render components, ensuring fast performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulations.
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework is an architectural/design pattern that separates an application into three main logical components Model, View, and Controller.



In React, we mainly have two types of components: 
1.Functional Components: Functional components are simply javascript functions. We can create a functional component in React by writing a javascript function. 
2.Class Components: The class components are a little more complex than the functional components. The functional components are not aware of the other components in your program whereas the class components can work with each other. We can pass data from one class component to another class component.
